Description: Ultrasound tongue imaging is a non-invasive technique used in phonetics
    experiments to obtain data on the position and shape of a speaker's tongue at
    certain points in time.  A thin, stiff object such as a straightedge may be
    entered into the speaker's mouth in order to provide an image of the occlusal
    plane before the actual measurements, based on which the other data may be
    oriented to the same plane.  This package provides a few basic, easy to use
    functions to rotate all tongue image data into the plane indicated by the
    straightedge.
